# Minimal Python dependencies for cisco.asa network_cli connection
# These are the only runtime requirements for SSH-based Ansible network automation

# SSH connectivity (required by cisco.asa via network_cli)
paramiko>=3.4.0,<4.0.0
cryptography>=41.0.0,<43.0.0

# Core Ansible dependencies (ansible-core brings these, but pinned for security)
pyyaml>=6.0.1,<7.0.0
jinja2>=3.1.0,<4.0.0

# Note: Removed unnecessary dependencies for minimal attack surface:
# - requests: Not used by cisco.asa or network_cli
# - netaddr: Not used in ED 25-03 playbooks/roles
