# System dependencies - NOT USED with UBI Micro multi-stage build
# 
# UBI Micro has no package manager, so all dependencies are installed
# in the builder stage and copied to the minimal runtime image.
# 
# See execution-environment.yml for the multi-stage build process.
#
# This file is kept for reference but is not processed by ansible-builder
# when using the multi-stage approach in additional_build_steps.
